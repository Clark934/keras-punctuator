# Keras Convolutional Text Punctuator

Is a small experimental project to punctuate text using a embedding layer, single convolutional layer and output softmax layer written in Keras. In current state it attempt to locate any of ",;.!?" and place a dot in their location.

This project is being used in practice in my Android app Youtube Reader [https://github.com/vackosar/youtube-reader](https://github.com/vackosar/youtube-reader).
